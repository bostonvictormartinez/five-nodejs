Java Sleep
this occurs in steps
System.out.printIn("first");
System.out.printIn("second");
Thread.sleep(1000);
System.out.printIn("third");

The output would be
first
second
third


this way is happens at the same time.
Node sleep
console.log("first");
setTimeout(function(){
console.log("third")}, 1000)
})
console.log("second")

output here all at once
